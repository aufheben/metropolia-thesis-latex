\section{Development Environment and Method}

Xilinx Vivado version 2017.04 is used as the development platform for FPGA. The typical workflow involves
the following steps: design the functionality of module, implement the module in Verilog, add IP blocks
if necessary, write the testbench for the module, run behavioral simulation, run synthesis and implementation,
run post-synthesis and post-implementation simulation, view synthesis and implementation reports, and finally,
create bitstream and test on device.

A parallel C implementation is developed on Linux simultaneously to facilitate the FPGA development.
Its main function is to provide algorithm verification, especially numerical comparison of output layers
between software implementation and FPGA implementation.
