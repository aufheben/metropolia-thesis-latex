\chapter{General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)}

The previous chapter discussed about different ways to view the convolution operation and its cousin,
the tranposed convolution, both conceptually and implementationally. When it comes down to implementation,
we have seen that both operations can be implemented with a single matrix multiplication. In other words,
matrix multiplication is the main computational burden of these operations, meanwhile, real world applications
often involve very large matrices. Therefore, as a low-level operation, the implemention of matrix
multiplication is often heavily optimized. General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is considered as the
\textit{de facto} standard operation contained in the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)
specification.

GEMM is defined as

$$C \leftarrow \alpha op(A) op(B) + \beta C,$$

where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, $op(X)$ is either $X$ or $X^\intercal$. In our particualr case for transposed convolution, $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = 1$, $op(X) = X$, so GEMM reduces to

$$C \leftarrow A B + C$$

where C is the bias matrix to be added to the product $A B$.

A näive implementation of GEMM in our reduced case could be as follows:

\begin{code}
  \begin{minted}{c}
    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world!\n");
    }
  \end{minted}

\end{code}
