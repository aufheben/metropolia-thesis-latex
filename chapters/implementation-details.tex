\section{Development Environment and Method}

Xilinx Vivado version 2017.04 was used as the development platform for \gls{fpga}. A typical workflow involves
the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design the functionality of \gls{rtl} module and the I/O ports
  \item Implement the module in Verilog, add IP blocks if necessary
  \item Write a testbench for the module, run behavioral simulation to confirm the module behaves as
    expected
  \item Run synthesis and implementation
  \item View synthesis and implementation reports to see if there are any issues, especially with timing
  \item Generate bitstream and test on the device
\end{itemize}

    A parallel C implementation is developed on Linux simultaneously to facilitate the \gls{fpga} development.
Its main function is to provide algorithm verification, especially numerical comparison of output layers
    between software implementation and \gls{fpga} implementation.

\section{Implementing the Transposed Convolutional Layer}

The first step in implementing the transposed convolutional layer is to simulate the nested C loops
described in listing \ref{code:transposed_convolution_in_c}. For a for-loop shown in listing
\ref{code:simple_for_c}, the corresponding Verilog code is shown in listing \ref{code:simple_for_verilog}
% The module is modeled as a FSM.

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}{c}
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // ...
    }
}
\end{minted}
  \captionof{listing}{Simple nested for-loop in C}
\label{code:simple_for_c}
\end{code}

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}{verilog}
reg [31:0] i = 0, i_next = 0;
reg [31:0] j = 0, j_next = 0;

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    i <= i_next;
    j <= j_next;
end

always @*
begin
    i_next = i;
    j_next = j;

    case (state)
        start:
            begin
                i_next = 0;
                j_next = 0;
                state_next = loop;
            end
        loop:
            begin
                if (j == n - 1)
                    begin
                        if (i == m - 1)
                            state_next = end;
                        i_next = i + 1;
                        j_next = 0;
                    end
                else
                    j_next = j + 1;
            end
        end:
            begin
            // finish the loop...
            end
        // handle other states ...
    endcase
end
\end{minted}

\end{code}

The code is separated into a sequential block and a combinational next-state logic block for clarity
\cite{Chu-Verilog}.
The merged C code of \mintinline{c}{gemm} and \mintinline{c}{col2im} shown in listing
\ref{code:transposed_convolution_in_c} can be then translated into Verilog using this structure
as a template.

The \mintinline{c}{transconv} module is connected to the input, weight, and output \glspl{bram}. A single
8-bit or 32-bit value is read or written in every cycle, which is quite inefficient. On the other hand,
although the data bus width can be configured for the \gls{bram}, a maximum of two read ports are available.
It is possible to increase the data bus width to read more bytes in each cycle, but this is left
as a future work for optimization. Indeed, I/O is the main bottleneck of the design, as in many other systems.

The DSP48 Macro IP is utilized to accomplish computations with multiplication and accumulation. The first
block implements the operations shown in table \ref{table:dsp48_0_operations}. The second block is the core
\gls{mac} unit, which only contains $P \leftarrow A*B+P$.

\begin{table}[h]

  \caption{DSP48 0 Operations}
  \begin{tabular}{l | l}
    0 & $P \leftarrow A*B-C$ \\
    1 & $P \leftarrow A*B+PCIN$ \\
    2 & $P \leftarrow A*B+C$
  \end{tabular}
  \label{table:dsp48_0_operations}
\end{table}

The ports of both blocks are shown in figure \ref{fig:dsp48_macro_0} and figure \ref{fig:dsp48_macro_1}.

\subsection{DSP48 Pipelining}

The DSP48 slice can be used without pipelining. However, that is essentially a combinational circuit and
the propagation delay will significantly reduce $F_{max}$. To run the \gls{fpga} at a higher frequency, it is
necessary to use pipeline registers. In the first version of the design, only the register after the
multiplier is used and the result is delayed by one clock cycle. This caused a negative \gls{wns} at
$100 MHz$ clock frequency, which indicates that timing requirements are not met in certain paths. By
using more pipeline registers, the results has a larger clock latency but $F_{max}$ can be improved.

  \label{fig:dsp48_macro_0_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\section{Implementing the Other Layers}

The batch normalization layer, ReLU layer, and Tanh layer are implemented with floating-point numbers.
Xilinx Vivado is shipped with a Floating-point IP which supports many common operations, including
conversion between fixed-point and floating-point formats, multiplication, accumulation, exponential function,
inverse square root, and many others. The input precision can be configured as half, single or
double-precision, or even customized width of exponent and fraction. It is also possible to choose
DSP slice usage, from logic only to maximum utilization of DSP48 slices. Finally, the user is able to decide
the goal of optimization, using minimum resources or maximum clock frequency $F_{max}$. Choosing maximum
clock frequency helps with the eventual timing closure, just as the case with DSP48 pipelining. An example
floating-point multiplier is shown in figure \ref{fig:floating_point_multiplier}.

\end{figure}

\section{Testbench}

Writing testbenches and performing simulations are a key step in \gls{fpga} development. In this project,
each module was developed as a separate project with a corresponding testbench module and a synthesizable
top module. The contents of these two modules are largely similar, but the testbench module usually operates
on relatively simple data to make simulation easier. Once a module has passed simulation and on-board test,
it is imported and integrated into the main project.
